Implementation of Virtual Mouse using Hand Gestures
In today’s world we see lots of development happened in the field of Technology. Today’s technology is combined with the technique called Artificial Intelligence. This project is also based on small part of AI. 

This project presents finger movement gesture detection on our computer’s window using camera & handling the whole system by just moving your one finger. Using finger detection methods for instant camera access and user-friendly user interface makes it more easily accessible. 

The system is used to implement motion tracking mouse, a signature input device and an application selector. This system reduces the use of any physical mouse which saves time and also reduces effort.
